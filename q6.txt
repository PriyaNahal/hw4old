1. The change inside increment_int_a doesn't change the variable a after the function call 
because increment_int_a(a) is calling by value, so only a copy of 'a' is passed. 

2. The change inside increment_int_b does change the variable b after the function call because 
'b' is a variable that can be mutable, so its value can be changed.

3. They differ in answer because 'a' is a variable that can't be changed whereas the variable 
'b' can be changed.
